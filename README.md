# Language Classification With Naive Bayes in Python

In this project, you will see how to clean and preprocess data for language classification, some basic theory behind Naive Bayes Modeling, and the impact that class imbalance of training data has on classification performance. Also, used subword units to further mitigate the negative effects of class imbalance and build an even better model.
